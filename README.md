# JRoboHash

## A Java (JVM) wrapper for the RoboHash API.

# Intro

This library is a Java/JVM wrapper for the RoboHash profile API.

# Using with Gradle

Make sure you have the following line in your `repositories` Gradle config (it is recommended that JitPack be at the
_end_ of the repositories section):

`maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }`

Then add the following to your dependencies: `implementation 'com.github.nathancheshire.jrobohash:COMMIT_HASH'`.

The `COMMIT_HASH` may vary depending on the targeted version (commit SHA) of JRoboHash you would like to use.

# API Support

This client features support for the comprehensive RoboHash API.
Using a builder pattern, all supported URL parameters are configurable via this API.
